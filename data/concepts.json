Within the parentheses, a maximum of three arguments can be taken. First, the current element being processed, then the index of that element, then finally the original array the method was called on.</p><p>.map() is particularly useful when creating multiple components from an array in React. For each element a function is applied that creates a new component that appears in the browser.</p><p>Here is an example below, where each number in the 'numbers' array is iterated over, passed into a function that doubles the number, before returning the new array 'doubledNumbers' which will return all the elements doubled.</p>",
